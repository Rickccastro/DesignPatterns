# 🎨 Design Patterns

This repository aims to demonstrate the implementation of some of the most commonly used design patterns in software development, organized into three main categories: Creational, Behavioral, and Structural.

## Implemented Patterns 🚀

### Creational Patterns 🏗️
Creational patterns deal with object instantiation, ensuring greater flexibility and code reuse.
- **Abstract Factory**: Allows the creation of families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing different configurations.
- **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for object creation, letting subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
- **Simple Factory**: Provides a method to create instances of different classes based on a given criterion.

### Behavioral Patterns 🎭
Behavioral patterns define how objects interact with each other.
- **Observer**: Enables automatic notification of changes to multiple observers.
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms and allows them to be interchangeable without altering the clients that use them.

### Structural Patterns 🏛️
Structural patterns help compose classes and objects to form larger and more efficient structures.
- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together through an intermediary class.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a set of more complex subsystem interfaces.

## How to Run 🏃
To test the pattern implementations, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
